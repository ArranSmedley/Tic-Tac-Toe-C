# Tic-Tac-Toe-C
This is a tic tac toe game i developed within C. This project was for my 2nd year of university within the 2nd semester in the algorithms and data structures course. To run this program rather go to the exe and run as administrator or go on the command line navigate to where the exe is and type tic-tac-toe. This project includes a 2 player mode and a basic 1 player mode with AI.
