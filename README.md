# Tic-Tac-Toe-C
This is a tic tac toe game i developed within C. 
This project was for my 2nd year of university within the 2nd semester in the algorithms and 
data structures course. To run this program 
Run the command “gcc”(the C-compiler ) followed by the full name of the program program (tic-tac-toe.c) 
in the command prompt. This will compile your source code and create an executable file on your desktop.
Then run the exe by typing in tic-tac-toe in the cmd or right clicking and running as administrator. This project includes a 2 player mode and a basic 1 player mode with AI.
